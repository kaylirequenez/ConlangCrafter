You are a skilled linguist typologist analyzing a constructed language. You have been provided with a complete language specification including vocabulary, grammar and phonology.

The hypothetical language has the following phonology:

=== START ===
{phonology}
=== END ===

It has the following grammar:

=== START ===
{grammar}
=== END ===

It has the following lexicon:

=== START ===
{lexicon_section}
=== END ===

Your goal is to determine which typological features best describe this language.
Evaluate the language’s typological profile using the following 18 features from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS):

1. Consonant inventory — Small (≤20) vs. Large (>20)
2. Vowel inventory — Small (<9) vs. Large (≥9)
3. Tone — Tonal vs. non-tonal
4. Morphological fusion — one of: isolating, agglutinating, fusional, polysynthetic
5. Affixation balance — Prefixing vs. suffixing
6. Gender inventory — none (0), few (1-2), moderate (3-5), or many (≥6)
7. Case inventory — Minimal, moderate, or extensive case systems
8. Numeral classifiers — Classifier vs. non-classifier
9. Basic word order — one of: SVO, SOV, VSO, VOS, OVS, OSV
10. Adposition type — Prepositions vs. postpositions
11. Genitive–noun order — Genitive before vs. after noun
12. Adjective–noun order — Adjectives before vs. after noun
13. Relative-clause order — Head-initial vs. head-final
14. Alignment typology — Nominative–accusative vs. active–stative
15. Causative morphology — present vs. absent
16. Passive morphology — present vs. absent
17. Applicative morphology — present vs. absent
18. Question-marking strategy — Interrogative particle vs. inversion

For each feature, determine which typological category the language fits best.  
If more than one morphological strategy is present, choose the one that is most dominant.
If a feature cannot be determined from the language description, mark it as `null`.

Then, output your judgment in **JSON format**, with one key per WALS feature.  
Use lowercase keys matching these exact labels:
"consonant_inventory", "vowel_inventory", "tone", "morphological_fusion", "affixation_balance",
"gender_inventory", "case_inventory", "numeral_classifiers", "basic_word_order", "adposition_type",
"genitive_noun_order", "adjective_noun_order", "relative_clause_order", "alignment_typology",
"causative_morphology", "passive_morphology", "applicative_morphology", "question_marking_strategy"


Example output:
{
  "consonant_inventory": "small",
  "vowel_inventory": "large",
  "tone": "non-tonal",
  "morphological_fusion": "agglutinating",
  "affixation_balance": "suffixing",
  "gender_inventory": "many",
  "case_inventory": "minimal",
  "numeral_classifiers": "non-classifier",
  "basic_word_order": "SOV",
  "adposition_type": "postpositional",
  "genitive_noun_order": "genitive-before-noun",
  "adjective_noun_order": "adjective-before-noun",
  "relative_clause_order": "head-final",
  "alignment_typology": "nominative–accusative",
  "causative_morphology": "present",
  "passive_morphology": "absent",
  "applicative_morphology": "absent",
  "question_marking_strategy": "interrogative-particle"
}

If a feature cannot be determined, set its value to `"null"`.
