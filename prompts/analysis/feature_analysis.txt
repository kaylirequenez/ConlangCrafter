You are a skilled linguist typologist analyzing a constructed language. You have been provided with a complete language specification including vocabulary, grammar and phonology.

The hypothetical language has the following phonology:

=== START ===
{phonology}
=== END ===

It has the following grammar:

=== START ===
{grammar}
=== END ===

{lexicon_section}

Your goal is to determine which typological features best describe this language.
Evaluate the language’s typological profile using the following 18 features from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS):

1. Consonant inventory — Small (≤20) vs. Large (>20)
2. Vowel inventory — Small (<9) vs. Large (≥9)
3. Tone — Tonal vs. non-tonal
4. Morphological fusion — one of: isolating, agglutinating, fusional, polysynthetic
5. Affixation balance — Prefixing vs. suffixing
6. Gender inventory — none (0), few (1-2), moderate (3-5), or many (≥6)
7. Case inventory — Minimal, moderate, or extensive case systems
8. Numeral classifiers — Classifier vs. non-classifier
9. Basic word order — one of: SVO, SOV, VSO, VOS, OVS, OSV
10. Adposition type — Prepositions vs. postpositions
11. Genitive–noun order — Genitive before vs. after noun
12. Adjective–noun order — Adjectives before vs. after noun
13. Relative-clause order — Head-initial vs. head-final
14. Alignment typology — Nominative–accusative vs. active–stative
15. Causative morphology — present vs. absent
16. Passive morphology — present vs. absent
17. Applicative morphology — present vs. absent
18. Question-marking strategy — Interrogative particle vs. inversion

Rules:
- If more than one strategy is present for a feature (e.g. both prefixing and suffixing), choose the one that is most dominant in the description.
- If a feature cannot be determined from the language description, set it to "null".
- Use the exact key names below.
