I am designing a hypothetical language's phonology. Provide me with {n_questions} sliders with scales from 1 to {scale_size}, and/or multiple-choice questions with {n_answers} possible answers (numbered 1-{scale_size}), to determine the most important typological features to construct this language's phonology. There should be {n_questions} of them total (counting sliders and multiple-choice questions together).
Provide no additional explanation or discussion.
