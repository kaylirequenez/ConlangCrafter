I am designing a hypothetical language's phonology.

Consider the following checklist:
== START CHECKLIST ==
{checklist}
== END CHECKLIST ==

Use values {values} for those respectively.
It should also obey the following constraint(s); if these contradict the above, these take priority:
{custom}

Now write a summary of its phonology.
Make sure there are a couple of aspects that are unusual, creative, interesting, or surprising, while still obeying the constraints from above.
Format your output as follows. Give no additional explanation or discussion.
