A hypothetical language has the following phonology and grammar:

=== START ===
{phonology}

{grammar}
=== END ===

It currently has the following partial lexicon:

=== START LEXICON ===
{lexicon}
=== END LEXICON ===

Add {n} new entries to this lexicon. Create new words that:
1. Follow the phonological constraints of the language
2. Are morphologically consistent with the grammar
3. Cover basic vocabulary areas (body parts, family, nature, actions, etc.)
4. Use appropriate derivational processes if specified in the grammar

Output only the new entries in the same CSV format:
ipa,pos,translation,grammar,derivation,notes

Do not include the existing entries, only the new ones. Provide no additional explanation.
