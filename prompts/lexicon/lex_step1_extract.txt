A hypothetical language has the following phonology and grammar:

=== START ===
{phonology}

{grammar}
=== END ===

Output a CSV with a lexicon of the language, including all lexical items that appear in the language's information above.

The CSV column names and their contents should be:
* "ipa": Lexical item as IPA (without brackets)
* "pos": Part of speech
* "translation": Translation of item into English
* "grammar": Any grammar points or information specific to that lexical item (e.g. inflectional or conjugational classes, irregularities, ...)
* "derivation": If the item is derived, note its derivation here
* "notes": Any additional notes

Provide translations for all lexical items, even those whose translations are not explicitly specified in the provided background above (i.e. don't list any translations as "unknown").

Do not provide any further explanation or text, only the CSV.
