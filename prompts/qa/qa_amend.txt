Here is a hypothetical language's phonology:
=== START ===
{content}
=== END ===

Here is a judgement of its overall consistency on a scale of 1 (completely inconsistent) - 5 (completely consistent), and specific issues found (if any) and their priorities (from 1=high to 3=low) and how to correct them:
{judgement}
Correct these points (and any other errors or inconsistencies, if any), outputting an amended version (without === START === / === END === lines). Give no additional explanation or discussion.
