Here is a translation result for a constructed language:
=== START ===
{content}
=== END ===

For context, here is the language specification:
=== START ===
{context}
=== END ===

Evaluate the quality and accuracy of this translation. Return a JSON with keys:
* "overall_score": Integer from 1 (completely incorrect) to 10 (excellent translation), scoring the translation overall. Consider:
  - Adherence to phonological rules (10: fully consistent, 8-9: minor violations, 5-7: some violations, 1-4: major violations)
  - Adherence to grammatical rules (10: fully consistent, 8-9: minor violations, 5-7: some violations, 1-4: major violations)
  - Appropriate use of lexicon (10: excellent use, 8-9: mostly appropriate, 5-7: some issues, 1-4: poor lexical choices)
  - Quality of glossing (10: accurate and complete, 8-9: mostly accurate, 5-7: some errors, 1-4: poor glossing)
  - Semantic accuracy (10: meaning preserved, 8-9: mostly preserved, 5-7: some meaning lost, 1-4: meaning significantly altered)
* "issues": List of problems found (if any). Each item should be an object with:
  * "issue": String describing the problem
  * "type": One of "phonological_violation"/"grammatical_violation"/"lexical_error"/"glossing_error"/"semantic_error"/"consistency_error"
  * "correction": String describing how the translation should be corrected
  * "priority": 1 (high -- major error affecting meaning or violating core rules), 2 (medium -- noticeable error), or 3 (low -- minor issue or style preference)

Be thorough in checking:
1. Phonological consistency: Do invented words follow the sound patterns and constraints?
2. Grammatical consistency: Are word order, morphology, and syntax rules followed?
3. Lexical appropriateness: Are existing words used correctly? Are new words justified and well-formed?
4. Glossing accuracy: Does the gloss correctly break down morphemes and grammatical functions?
5. Semantic preservation: Does the translation convey the intended meaning?
6. Internal consistency: Are new rules and words consistent with each other?

Output only this JSON object. Give no additional explanation or discussion.
