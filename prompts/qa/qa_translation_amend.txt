Here is a translation result for a constructed language that might need improvement:
=== START ===
{content}
=== END ===

Based on this quality assessment:
=== START ===
{judgement}
=== END ===

Please provide an improved version of the translation that addresses the identified issues. Make sure to:

1. Fix any phonological violations by adjusting words to follow the sound patterns
2. Correct grammatical errors to match the specified rules
3. Improve lexical choices and justify any new words created
4. Ensure accurate glossing with proper morpheme breakdown
5. Preserve semantic meaning while fixing technical issues
6. Maintain consistency across all elements

Return the corrected translation in the same JSON format as the original:

{{
    "sentences": [
        {{
            "conlang_sentence": "<corrected sentence in the constructed language only - no glosses, morpheme breaks, or explanations>",
            "gloss": "<corrected word-by-word breakdown with morphemes and grammatical functions>",
            "new_words": [{{"<new_word>": "<english_translation>"}}],
            "new_grammar_rules": [{{"rule": "<description_of_new_rule>", "justification": "<explanation_of_why_needed_and_consistency>"}}]
        }}
    ]
}}

Output only this JSON object. Give no additional explanation or discussion.
