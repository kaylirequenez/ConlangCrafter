I am designing a hypothetical language's grammar.

Consider the following checklist:
== START CHECKLIST ==
{checklist}
== END CHECKLIST ==

Use values {values} for those respectively.

A hypothetical language has the following phonology:
=== START ===
{phonology}
=== END ===

It should also obey the following constraint(s); if these contradict the above, these take priority:
{custom}

Now write a summary of its grammar (morphology and syntax).
Make sure there are a couple of aspects that are unusual, creative, interesting, or surprising, while still obeying the constraints from above.
Format your output as follows. Give no additional explanation or discussion.

# Grammar

## Morphology

(Description of morphological processes)

## Word Order

(Description of basic word order and variations)

## Case System

(Description of case marking, if any)

## Verb System

(Description of tense, aspect, mood, agreement)

## Other Features

(Any other notable grammatical features)
